[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 2]
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 3]
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

6,A Day in the Life,"May 26, 1967",Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,"

[Verse 1: John Lennon]
I read the news today—oh, boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords

[Verse 2: John Lennon]
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on

[Bridge: Paul McCartney]
*alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream

[Verse 3: John Lennon]
I read the news today—oh, boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

[Refrain: John Lennon]
I'd love to turn you on

If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my Body
And give the Letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester: seek him out upon the English Party
Oh, untimely death, death–”

“What, is he dead?”
“Sit you down, Father; rest you”

Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream

All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?

Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there

Where do they all belong?

All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better

With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living

There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping

How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes

Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room

Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, ""It's time for bed""

I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath

I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?

When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

And if you say the word
I could stay with you

I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save

Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say

Joan was quizzical
Studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine
Calls her on the phone
""Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?""
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead

[Verse 2]
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times ""I must not be so, o, o, o""
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind

[Chorus]
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
(Do-do-do-do)
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
(Do-do-do-do)

[Verse 3]
P. C. 31 said, ""We caught a dirty one,""
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie
Screaming from the gallery, say he must go free
(Maxwell must go free)
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind

Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head

There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, ""I'm gonna get that boy""
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon

Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival

His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, ""Danny boy, this is a showdown""
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner

[Verse 3]
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, ""Rocky, you met your match""
And Rocky said, ""Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able""

And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival

...bottle of claret for you if I'd realised
I'd forgotten all about it, George, I'm sorry
Well do next time
Will you forgive me?
Mmmyes
Cheeky bitch

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number

[Verse 1]
Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen time your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine

Who's to know?
Who was to know?

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

[Verse 2]
I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives

[Verse 3]
I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rogue doctors have brought this specimen

I have nobody's short-cuts, aha

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

Ooh

[Verse 4]
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low

[Pre-Chorus]
Alright!

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

[Verse 5]
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So instead I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea

Block that kick, block that kick!

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Um da
Aaah

[Verse 6]
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming

Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building

Onion soup

[Chorus]
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine

Industrial output
Financial imbalance

Thrusting it between his shoulder blades

The Watusi
The Twist

El Dorado

Take this brother, may it serve you well

Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh

[Verse 7]
Maybe even then
Exposure could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked
If you become naked

[Outro]
Hold that line, hold that line!
Block that kick, block that kick!

Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)

Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

[Chorus: Paul McCartney & (John Lennon)]
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)

She's leaving home after living alone (Bye-bye)

Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade

Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)

Something inside that was always denied (Bye-bye)
For so many years

58,For No One,"August 5, 1966",Revolver (UK),"

[Verse 1]
Your day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you

[Verse 2]
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

[Bridge]
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 3]
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[French Horn Solo]

[Bridge]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 4]
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him

[Verse 5]
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her

[Bridge]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still

See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?

Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue

You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

[Verse 3]
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you

[Chorus]
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see

Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea

While my guitar gently weeps

I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 4]
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 5]
I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I’m sitting here, doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song

You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no one there

Put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Oh girl, you look so fine
Just a-rocking and a-rolling
Girl I said I wish you were mine

[Interlude]
Aw!
Aw!
Woo!

[Verse 3]
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
When you call my name
Oooh baby
Say you're driving me insane
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby
I want to be your loving man

[Interlude]
Ooh
Ooh
Aw!

[Verse 4]
Run and tell your mama
I want you to be my bride
Run and tell your brother
Baby, don't run and hide
You make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy
Girl, I want to marry you

[Verse 2]
Come on, give me fever
Put your little hand in mine, girl
You make me dizzy, dizzy Lizzy
Girl, you look so fine
You're just a-rocking and a-rolling
Oh I said I wish you were mine

[PROLOGUE]
NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland. Eighty thousand leagues beneath the sea it lay... or lie, I'm not too sure.

[00:01:49 THE BLUE MEANIES OVERLOOK PEPPERLAND]

CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe. It must be scratched.
Right, Max?
MAX:
Yes, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
What?! We Meanies only take NO for an answer. Is that understood, Max?
MAX:
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
That's better. Are the troops in readiness?
MAX:
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
The Bonkers?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Clowns?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Snapping Turks?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Anti-music missiles?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
The dreadful Flying Glove?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Splendid! Today, Pepperland goes blooey! Fire!

[The first blue bubble encloses the stand where the band plays. Everybody runs scared.]

FRED:
The Meanies are coming! The Meanies are coming!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove! Look out there, and what do you see? Tell him, Max.
MAX:
Someone running, Glove.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Yes. Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey? Go, Glove, point! And having pointed, pounce down! I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii! What?! What?! What?! The Glove is losing his touch. Do your worst! Explode them!
FRED [to the GLOVE, which is pointed him]:
It's not polite to point!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Thing of beauty... Destroy it for ever!
FRED [to the MAYOR and other three people who are playing music.]:
Sir, Sir, the Meanies are coming!
MAYOR:
Not here, young Fred. They wouldn't dare.
FRED:
They would. They are. What are you going to do?
MAYOR:
Finish the quartet.
BLUE MEANIES:
Fire!

[One bomb gets one musician.]

FRED:
Trio, sir.

[Another bomb gets the second musician.]

FRED:
Duet, sir.
MAYOR
Duet?

[The third musician is hit with a bomb too.]

FRED:
Solo!
MAYOR:
Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!

[FRED takes the MAYOR in his arms and runs.]

MAYOR:
4 scores and 32 bars ago our forefathers...
FRED:
Our quartet?
MAYOR:
And foremothers...
FRED:
Another quartet?
MAYOR:
Made it in this yellow submarine...
FRED:
What, that little thing?
MAYOR:
To Pepperland. Climb aboard, young Fred.
FRED:
But, sir, I can't even make my soap float.
MAYOR:
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.
FRED:
Lord Admiral? In that event, yes.
MAYOR:
Hurry, Young Fred. Go! Get help!
FRED:
Where should I go?
MAYOR:
No time for trivialities.

[As the BLUE MEANIES bomb the MAYOR, FRED sails away.]

CREDITS
[0:07:41 THE BEATLES: YELLOW SUBMARINE]
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
…
Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain.
Full speed ahead.
Full speed it is, sir.
Action stations! Action stations!
Aye, sir, aye.
Captain, Captain!
As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine,
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine,
…

[0:10:20 THE YELLOW SUBMARINE GETS TO LIVERPOOL]

[0:11:03 THE BEATLES: ELEANOR RIGBY]
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear
No-one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No-one was saved
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?

[0:13:14 STREET OF LIVERPOOL]

RINGO:
Who... is me? Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night. And this is only Thursday morning. Compared with my life, Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl. Nothing ever happens to me. I feel like an old, splintered drumstick. I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain. Nothing ever happens to me.

[As RINGO walks down Hope Street, is followed by the submarine. A bobby lies on the floor playing with a cat.]

BOBBY:
Puss, puss-puss. Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy. [The Bobby sees Ringo] Ahem, er...
RINGO:
Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?
BOBBY:
No, I would not.
RINGO:
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.

[Ringo goes up a hill to reach The Pier, the house where he lives with the other Beatles.]

RINGO:
I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine. But that isn't logical, is it? It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.
But I don't have an imagination.

[RINGO enters the house. FRED comes and knocks at the door.]

FRED:
Help, help, help!
RINGO [from inside]:
Thanks, I don't need any.
FRED:
Help! Won't you please, please help me?
RINGO:
Be specific.
FRED:
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO:
What you need is...
FRED:
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent, 'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-p-p-please help.

[0:16:08 THE HOUSE OF THE BEATLES]

[Door opens and Fred enters. There is a long corridor with many doors. A lot of strange things enter and leave the rooms.]

VOZ:
Hiya, baby!

[RINGO goes downstairs in a car.]

RINGO:
Your story has touched my heart. Jump in, we'll get my friends.
FRED:
Bless you!
RINGO:
Did I sneeze?

[They return to the corridor.]

FRED:
Just park it here.
RINGO:
I'll just park it here.

[They enter through a door.]

FRED:
What would your friends be doing here?
RINGO:
Displaying.
FRED:
Displaying what?
RINGO:
Displaying around.

[The room is full of interesting objects, like a museum.]

FRED:
Can't we take one of these?
RINGO:
No, Fred, I only work with me mates.
FRED:
Frankenstein?
RINGO:
I used to go out with his sister.
FRED:
His sister?
RINGO:
Yeah. Phyllis. Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever.
FRED:
You mustn't do that.
RINGO:
Can't help it. I'm a born lever-puller.

[He does it. Frankenstein gets up and takes a drink. Then he becomes JOHN.]

JOHN:
Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream.
RINGO:
I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach. Now listen to old Fred.
FRED:
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO:
What do you think?
JOHN:
I think he needs a rehearsal.

[They return to the hall.]

JOHN:
When do we leave?
RINGO:
Let's get the other two, John.
JOHN:
What day is it?
RINGO:
Sitar-day.
JOHN:
Then George will be here.

[He opens a door. Indian images.]

[0:18:55 THE BEATLES: LOVE YOU TO (beginning)]

RINGO:
George, what are you doing up there?
GEORGE [driving a red car]:
Now, what is it, Ringo? Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down?
RINGO [pointing to FRED]:
This chap here...
FRED [JOHN and RINGO also say the last words]:
...Blue Meanies!!!
GEORGE:
You're nuts, the pair of you.
RINGO:
Wait a minute, that's my car.
GEORGE:
How do you know it's your car?
RINGO:
I'd know it anywhere.
GEORGE:
What's it look like, then?
RINGO:
It's red with yellow wheels. [The car changes colours]I mean, blue with orange wheels.
GEORGE:
It's all in the mind.

[They all get into the car.]

RINGO:
Come on, move over, I'm driving.
GEORGE:
I got here first.

[They argue about who will drive.]

RINGO/GEORGE:
I'll drive, if you like... No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then.

[Finally, they depart. A car crash is heard. They return and open a door. Inside the room there is a girl lying on a bed. King-Kong looks through the window and grabs the girl.]

JOHN:
Do you think we're interrupting something?
RINGO:
I think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?

[JOHN opens another door. A train is coming at full speed. John closes the door, scared.]

GEORGE:
It's all in the mind.
JOHN:
Try one of those doors.

[RINGO opens a door. Inside the room there is a loud party.]

GEORGE:
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?
RINGO:
Yes, they do.
JOHN:
They do, though, don't they?
GEORGE:
Yes, they do.
RINGO:
Don't dey, dough?
GEORGE:
Dough?

[PAUL meets them.]

JOHN:
Don't ask. Dat's dough.
PAUL:
What's the matter, folks?
RINGO:
Blue Meanies.
FRED:
Well, lads, what do you think?
JOHN [as they walk]:
I think that...
FRED:
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead. So, what do you think?
PAUL:
Well, then, um...
FRED:
Pounding, overwhelming waves. What do you think of that?
JOHN:
Well, I think that...
RINGO:
As a matter of fact, I...
ALL BEATLES:
I think...
FRED:
Well?
RINGO:
I've forgotten.

[They all go outside and stop in front of the submarine.]

FRED:
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.
JOHN:
I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.

[0:22:18 THE JOURNEY BEGINS]

We see a series of landscapes. We hear the end of “A day in the life”.

[0:22:45 INSIDE THE SUBMARINE]

PAUL:
So, this is a submarine.
JOHN:
Soft, isn't it?
RINGO:
Not if you're on the bottom.
FRED:
All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to.
PAUL:
Groovy. How do you start this thing?
FRED:
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.
JOHN:
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?
FRED:
Then you start looking for a switch.
RINGO:
Perhaps this is it.

[The submarine sails into a strange world.]

[0:23:22 THE BEATLES: ALL TOGETHER NOW]
One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you
A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now (all together now)…
Black, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed?
Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you (All together now)
All together now (all together now),
all together now (all together now)...
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now (all together now)…

[0:25:30 THE SEA OF TIME]

RINGO:
What time is it?
JOHN:
It's time to time.
PAUL:
Look, the hands are slowing down.

[The submarine sails backwards.]

PAUL:
Do you ever get the feeling...
JOHN:
Yeah.
PAUL:
… that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?
RINGO:
What's happening, John?
JOHN:
Well, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.
GEORGE:
All right.
JOHN:
Relatively speaking, that is.
GEORGE:
Of course. Maybe time's gone on strike.
RINGO:
What for?
GEORGE:
Shorter hours.
RINGO:
I don't blame it. It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?
JOHN & PAUL:
Why?
RINGO:
It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?
JOHN:
You surprise me, Ringo.
RINGO:
Why?
JOHN:
Dealing in abstracts.
RINGO:
Just because I'm a drummer... I don't half feel funny.

[RINGO shrinks, becoming younger]

PAUL [also getting younger]:
You're not half the lad you used to be.
GEORGE [getting younger]
Look, everything's getting bigger.
JOHN [getting younger]:
It's not. It's us that are getting smaller...
RINGO [mourning]:
I want my mam.
FRED:
And younger. There you are, lads. Old Fred will get you out of all this.
RINGO [pointing outside]
Look at that!
GEORGE:
It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
JOHN:
It's not. It's Father Time.
GEORGE:
How do you know?
JOHN:
I read it in a book.
FRED:
I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.
GEORGE:
What's that mean, old Fred?
FRED:
It means if we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.
JOHN:
What are we gonna do, then?
FRED:
We could always try a few buttons.
RINGO [sobbing]:
I want my mam.
FRED:
Time's fast running out for us, I'm afraid!
JOHN:
Can't we do something to the clock?
GEORGE:
What do you mean, John?
JOHN:
Move the hands forward, see what happens.
FRED:
Clever lad.

[JOHN forces the clockwise and the submarine goes forwards.]

JOHN:
Something strange is happening. It's speeding up now.
PAUL [looking outside]:
Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own.
JOHN:
Uncannily.
RINGO:
There's someone in it. Look.
JOHN:
And they're waving.
RINGO:
It's a group of fellas.
JOHN:
Wave back. Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.
RINGO:
There's only two of us.
JOHN:
Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is one of ourselves…
FRED:
Going backwards...
JOHN:
… in time!
GEORGE:
Look at Ringo.

[RINGO is getting older, and so the rest.]

JOHN:
Oh dear, we're all the same.
PAUL:
Senile delinquents.
GEORGE:
And I can hear my beard growing.
RINGO:
We'd better do something.

[0:28:20 THE BEATLES: WHEN I’M SIXTY FOUR]
When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older, too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
[As Paul sings, time is going back and The Beatles turn back to their real age.]
[A text can be read: “sixty-four years is 33.661.440 minutes and one minute is a
long time… Let us demonstrate”.]
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
[A series of well illustrated numbers accompany the voice of Paul form 1 to 64, matching the last one with the end of the song.]
Every summer we can rent a cottage
in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee,
Vera, Chuck and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely
what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form,
mine forever more
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

JOHN:
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?
RINGO:
That would explain a few things. I'm glad I'm not young any more. Or was it old?
JOHN:
What kind of a sea is this?
FRED:
The Sea of Science.
JOHN:
Oh, yeah.

[0:31:15 THE BEATLES: A NORTHERN SONG]
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter
What chords I play
What words I say
Or time of day it is
Cause it's only a Northern Song
It doesn't really matter
What clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern Song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no-one there.

[0:33:46 A MONSTER WITH A TRUNK AND TUSKS]

[As the song sounded The Beatles evolved through the space. When they come back to the submarine a strange animal enters with them.]

GEORGE:
He looks wrong.
PAUL:
He doesn't look at all well.
GEORGE:
In fact, he's horrible.
JOHN [hiding.]:
He's so ugly.
ALL:
Really ugly!

[The animal breaks to mourn.]

FRED:
Somebody push a button.

[RINGO does so and the animal is ejected outside the submarine to the Sea of Monsters.]

[0:34:18 SEA OF MONSTERS]

JOHN:
There's a cyclops.
PAUL:
Can't be. He's got two eyes.
JOHN:
Then it must be a bi-cyclops.
GEORGE:
There's another one.
JOHN:
A whole cyclopedia.

[Among the monsters there is one that swallows everything like a vacuum. The BEATLES look out the hatch.]

JOHN:
There's a school of whales.
RINGO:
They look a bit old for school.
PAUL:
University, then.
RINGO [driving the submarine]:
University of Whales. They look like dropouts to me.
FRED:
You've got to steer clear!
RINGO:
Steer clear?
FRED:
Yes, steer. Clear?
RINGO:
Yes, dear.

[RINGO presses a button. The submarine shows a big smile. The whales smile too.]

FRED:
Now, whatever you do, don't touch that button.
RINGO:
Which button?
FRED:
That one.
RINGO:
This one?

[RINGO presses the button and is ejected from the submarine onto the back of a dinosaur. Before he is eaten, he is rescued by a horse-like creature.]

FRED:
That was the panic button.
PAUL:
Poor Ringo.
JOHN:
Poor lad.
GEORGE:
Never did no harm to no-one.
JOHN:
Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?
FRED:
Learn to sing trios.
PAUL:
No, let's save the poor devil.
JOHN:
I see footsteps.
FRED:
It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
JOHN:
Preparing to attack.

[The boots try to step on the submarine, but PAUL presses a button and the submarine steps on the boots.]

JOHN:
I don't half miss Ringo.
PAUL:
He's far out there.
JOHN:
Always was.
RINGO:
'H' is for hurry!
PAUL:
Here comes Ringo!

[RINGO rides the horse creature.]

JOHN:
There goes Ringo.

[A boxing monster approaches the submarine.]

GEORGE:
It's seen us.
FRED:
Find a boxing button.
PAUL:
Whoever heard of a boxing button?
JOHN:
Who cares? Find one.

[The boxing monster hits the submarine.]

FRED [pushing a button]:
Fire one!

[The submarine expels lot of strange gadgets, including a banner with the words “The Rolling Stones”.]

FRED:
Uh-oh, wrong one.
JOHN:
That.

[The submarine flatters the monsters with a cigar. We hear “Air on the G-string”, de Bach until the cigar explodes.]

GEORGE:
There goes Ringo again.
JOHN:
Rides well, doesn't he?
RINGO:
'E' is for ergent...

[The vacuum monster appears again.]

FRED:
Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum again.
PAUL:
We'll be sucked into oblivion.
GEORGE:
Or even further.
FRED:
Put her in reverse.
JOHN:
So long, sucker.
PAUL:
Too much.
GEORGE:
Too soon.
FRED:
Reverse! Reverse!
JOHN:
Ringo time.

[Another monster is swallowed by the vacuum monster.]

RINGO:
'L' is for love me...

[Indians go chasing RINGO.]

JOHN:
Indians!
RINGO:
Help! Help! 'P' is for please...
JOHN:
So, press a button.

[0:39:33. The seventh cavalry leaves the submarine and rescues RINGO.]

JOHN:
How was it, Ringo?
RINGO [pulling arrows off himself]:
'Arrowing.

[The vacuum monster keeps gobbling other monsters.]

FRED:
Look who's back. Full speed ahead.
RINGO:
Oh, no.
JOHN:
The motor's packing in.
FRED:
By all the sea nymphs, we're losing power. We're being swallowed. What shall we do?
PAUL:
Serve tea.
JOHN:
Lovely.

[The vacuum monster swallows everything, including itself.]

[The submarine is left in nothing.]

FRED:
By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.
JOHN:
Maybe we should call a road service.
PAUL:
Can't. No road.
RINGO:
And we're not sub-scribers.
JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE:
Subscribers! Oh!
GEORGE:
I know something about motors. Let me have a look.
FRED:
Here.
GEORGE:
Is that the motor?
FRED:
Can't you tell one when you see one?
GEORGE:
Of course I can. Let me peruse it.

[Put his finger on the motor and get shocked.]

JOHN:
What do you think?
GEORGE:
I think I burned my finger.
RINGO [looking outside]:
Here, lads. Look at this.
JOHN:
What do you think it is?
GEORGE:
Nothing.
RINGO:
Looks like nothing.
PAUL:
It's a local inhabitant.
RINGO:
He's probably one of the nothings.
PAUL:
At least that's something. Let's show him our motor.
JOHN:
Steady on. You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.
GEORGE:
But this is a nobody.
JEREMY:
Medic, pedic, zed oblique,
orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
JOHN:
Can you tell us where we're at?
JEREMY:
A true Socratic query, that.
JOHN:
And who the Billy Shears are you?
JEREMY:
Who? Who indeed am I?

[He gives a different visiting card to each BEATLE.]

JOHN [reading card]:
Jeremy?
PAUL [reading card]:
Hillary?
GEORGE [reading card]:
Boob?
RINGO [reading card]:
Ph. D?
ALL:
Who?
JEREMY:
Eminent physicist, polyglot classicist,
prize-winning botanist,
hard biting satirist,
talented pianist, good dentist, too.
JOHN:
Lousy poet.
JEREMY:
Critic's voice, take your choice.
RINGO:
Must be one of them angry young men.
PAUL:
Or a daffy old creep.
JEREMY:
I, daffy old creep?
GEORGE:
Do you speak English?
JEREMY:
Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...
PAUL:
Well, do you speak English?
JEREMY:
You know, I'm not sure.
RINGO:
He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows.
PAUL:
Why don't we show him our motor?
JOHN:
Should we really... show him our motor?
PAUL:
He may not have seen one before.
JEREMY:
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic,
This motor, I see, has a broken down thing.
JOHN:
He fixed it?
PAUL:
He fixed it.
GEORGE:
Great. Let's go.
JEREMY:
I must complete my bust, two novels,
finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.
JOHN:
Must you always talk in rhyme?
JEREMY:
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
PAUL:
Hey, fellas. Look.
JEREMY:
The footnotes for my 19th book.
This is my standard procedure for doing it.
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.
GEORGE:
A boob for all seasons.
PAUL:
How can he lose?
JOHN:
Were your notices good?
JEREMY:
It's my policy never to read my reviews.
JOHN:
There must be a word for what he is.

[0:43:00 THE BEATLES: NOWHERE MAN]
He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man, can you see me at all?
Nowhere Man, don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else
lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody

JOHN:
Okay, men, all aboard. Let's go somewhere.
RINGO:
What about him?
JOHN:
He's happy enough going around in circles.
RINGO:
Poor little fella.
PAUL:
I don't know. Ringo's just a sentimentalist.
RINGO:
Look at him. Can't he come with us? [Goes over to JEREMY]
Mr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like.
JEREMY:
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?
RINGO:
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.

[Inside the submarine, JOHN gives FRED the motor.]

JOHN [to JEREMY]
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.
JEREMY [laughing]:
Down the hatch. A quite curious phrase.
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.
It's usage undoubtedly on the increase.
I must work it into
my New Statesman piece.
JOHN:
That's the hatch, friend.
JEREMY:
Indeed.
FRED:
Steady now, crew. Prepare to go forward.
GEORGE:
Forward.
PAUL:
Forward.
JOHN:
Forward.
RINGO:
Forward.
ALL:
Forward!

[But the submarine has problems going forward.]

JOHN:
It's awfully quiet.
GEORGE:
What shall we do, Jeremy?
JEREMY:
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.

[The BEATLES and JEREMY go outside.]

JEREMY:
Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
JOHN:
What's he saying?
PAUL:
What's he doing?
JEREMY:
Chewing gum will do the job. A turn of the screw, and all is and all is new.

[The submarine stars, but only FRED is on board.]

FRED:
I can't stop her. 'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent, 'L' is for love me…
JOHN:
'P' is for... goodbye?
GEORGE:
That was lovely, Jeremy.
PAUL:
We've lost the sub for good.
JOHN:
Or for bad. Or for worse.
JEREMY:
I'm sorry about that.
RINGO:
But he did fix the motor.
PAUL:
Where are we?

[They stand on a head. There are a lot of heads around.]

JOHN:
It looks like the foothills.
PAUL:
The foothills of what?
JOHN:
The foothills of the headlands.

[0:48:06 THE BEATLES: LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS]
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees
and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you,
you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun
in her eyes and she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people
eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles
as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head
in the clouds and you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters
with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds…

[0:51:09 ON THE FOOTHILLS OF THE HEADLANDS]

JOHN:
Carry on, lads, carry on.
RINGO:
Certainly was carrying on.
JOHN:
I feel a draft.
PAUL:
We must be near the Sea of Holes. Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions?
JOHN [talking to a mass of heads]
Excuse us...
PAUL:
Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?

[The heads point arrows, but the arrows point in circles.]

JOHN:
Thanks.
PAUL:
Gosh, look at all this dust? Where did it come from?
JEREMY:
A chemical error and quite imprecise. This is a condiment...
RINGO:
Condi...
JEREMY:
A spice.
JOHN:
He's right, you know. It's pepper.
PAUL:
Pepper?
GEORGE:
Pepper.

[They smell and sneeze. The mass of heads sneeze too. They fly into the Sea of Holes.]

[0:52:08 THE SEA OF HOLES]

RINGO:
John? Paul? George? Is anybody home?
PAUL:
Where are we?
JOHN:
A holey sea. This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire.
PAUL:
Oh, boy...
GEORGE:
How many do you think there are in all?
JEREMY:
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.
PAUL:
Didn't old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes just before the Sea of Green?
JOHN:
Yeah.
GEORGE:
Through one of them spots must be the Sea of Green. But which? Which one?
JEREMY:
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation.
JOHN:
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?
JEREMY:
There are simply no holes in my education.
PAUL:
You mean you haven't composed a whole book?
GEORGE:
Great. What shall we do?
JEREMY:
Be empirical. Look.
RINGO:
The booby's making more and more sense.
PAUL:
It's getting better all the time.
JOHN:
Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green. The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green.
JEREMY:
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.
I think we're near the Sea of Green.

[JEREMY is caught by the leg by a BLUE MEANIE. RINGO picks a hole up and plays with it for a while before to put it in his pocket.]

RINGO:
I've got a hole in me pocket.
PAUL:
Where's Jeremy?
JOHN:
He was over there.
GEORGE:
He's not here now.
PAUL:
He must have jumped ship, then.
RINGO:
He wouldn't do that. He's our friend. Booby, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?

[0:54:29 Suddenly, everything is tinted of green as we hear a bit part of the song Yellow submarine: “Sea of green, sea of green, sea of green, green, green, green...”]

[The BEATLES arrive in Pepperland, just on the base of the temple.]

[0:54:41 PEPPERLAND]

JOHN:
Pepperland. A bit salty around the edges. Looks all dingy.
GEORGE:
And drab.
PAUL:
And quiet.

[RINGO finds a pile of apples. He takes one and passes it to PAUL.]

JOHN:
Safe at last.
PAUL:
And none the worse for our adventures.
JOHN:
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses.
RINGO:
There's an eye in the apples.

[RINGO brings down the pile of apples and uncovers the MAYOR. The Yellow Submarine comes down from the sky and lands on the house of music. FRED descends sitting down in an anchor.]

FRED:
There she blows! Lord Mayor, sir... I've made it, I'm back.
GEORGE:
Who's this?
FRED:
Our Lord Mayor. He's been bonked. [Ringo removes the apples]. Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself. Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again.
JOHN:
All right, let's sing.

[0:55:54 THE BEATLES: HAVE YOU GOT TIME TO RECTIFY]
Have you got time to rectify, time to rectify...

MAYOR:
Do I hear music? Do I see... young Fred?
FRED:
You do, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR:
Bless my metronome. And did you bring the help?
FRED:
Yes, yes. Look.
MAYOR:
Holy pizzicato, young Fred. It's quite uncanny, your faces...
PAUL:
We're quite cute, really.
MAYOR:
You could pass for the originals.
JOHN:
We are the originals.

[They go downstairs from the house of music.]

MAYOR:
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
RINGO:
They couldn't be much with a name like that. Sergeant Pepper?
FRED
You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion.
MAYOR
Where are your instruments?
JOHN
Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
PAUL
Sea of Monsters.
FRED
We'll get other instruments, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR
Not a chance. The Meanies captured everything that maketh music.
PAUL
They hate music that much, do they?
MAYOR
They shrink at the very sound.
JOHN
Okay, you guys. It's shrinking time in Pepperland.
All people in Pepperland keeps grey and motionless (except for escape from the blue
meanies).
BLUE MEANIE
Aim, fire!
The Beatles hide behind cut-outs.
PAUL
He reminds me of my old English teacher.
JOHN
Look, if you must shout, shout quietly.
GEORGE
What do we do?
JOHN
Coagulate with the crowd.
PAUL
Cut-outs at the ready.
JOHN
Then let's cut out.
They come to a high bandstand surrounded by thorns.
PAUL
What a grand bandstand.
JOHN
That's where the gear's kept. Come on.
Blue meanies with dogs.
GEORGE
Cavey, cavey.
At dusk.
PAUL
All right, the coast is clear.
GEORGE
Now's our chance.
RINGO
But how'll we get over?
GEORGE
Easy. Follow me.
They jump the fence of thorns
BLUE MEANIE
A-ha! You fools!
The watch fires his machine gun.
The Beatles reach the bandstand moving between asleep blue meanies.
RINGO
It's not very light in here, is it?
GEORGE
Shh! Keep the noise down.
JOHN
Look what I found. It's their uniforms.
PAUL
Nice bit of gear, that.
RINGO
They'll look great on, eh?
PAUL
Dey will, won't dey?
RINGO
Won't dey, dough.
JOHN
How do I look?
PAUL
Groovy, groovy. How about me?
RINGO, looking thru the window
Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
GEORGE
Oh, heck.
RINGO
A million billion Meanies.
PAUL
They're coming this way.
ALL
Hide!
Trying to hide they make a lot of noise.
PAUL
Do you think they heard us?
JOHN
I hope not.
GEORGE
What did you say?
SOMEONE
Shhhh!
GEORGE
Good plan.
1:03:22 DAWN, by Grieg.
PAUL
Look. They're all asleep.
RINGO
They look cute when they're asleep. Almost human.
GEORGE
Come on. Let's get out of here.
PAUL
On tiptoe.
They take their instruments and go down the hill.
RINGO
Tiptoe through the Meanies...
THE OTHER
Shh!
Ringo steps on the bagpipe. Some meanies wake.
PAUL
Let's exude.
The Beatles are persecuted. Ringo falls down and jumps on the John arms.
GEORGE
Relax, lads. Not a Meanie in sight.
JOHN
Not even a teeny Meanie.
PAUL
Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.
RINGO
Great.
PAUL
Oh, look. Breakfast.
RINGO
I'm dying for a bit of brekky.
George takes an apple. Four tall meanies do the same.
JOHN
Look out.
A blue meanie heads the four tall meanies.
CHIEF
Sound off, one, two, three, four...
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three, four...
The Beatles, one above the other, march behind the row of tall meanies.
JOHN
Five.
CHIEF
Five? [John eliminates the last one with an apple stroke.] Sound off, one, two, three,
four.
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three...
JOHN
Four.
John eliminates another one.
TALL MEANIES
One, two...
JOHN
Three.
CHIEF
Three?
JOHN
Two.
CHIEF
Two?
JOHN
One.
CHIEF
One? [The chief stares at the column made of the four Beatles] Are you Bluish? You
don't look Bluish.
JOHN
Run for it.
The Beatles escape again.
PAUL
Right, men. We've made it.
GEORGE
Instruments at the ready.
JOHN
Okay, on the beat. A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six…
RINGO
Hey, can't you make it three?
JOHN
All right. On the beat of three... A-one, a-two, a-three...
1:06:34 THE BEATLES: SGT. PEPPER’S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND
It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style,
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you,
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here,
it's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience,
we'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really wanna stop the show,
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's gonna sing a song,
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you,
The one and only Billy Shears
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
THE BEATLES: WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
Billy Shears!
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
The inhabitants of Pepperland recover color and smile. Lennon has been presented as Billy Shears, but Ringo’s voice is heard.
01:08:49 THE MEANIES GATHER AROUND THEIR CHIEF
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! The hills are alive...
ASSISTANT
With the sound of music.
The Chief Blue Meanie hits his assistant. Then he gets a tantrum.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Who is responsible for this?
ASSISTANT
Rimsky Korsakov?
The assistant is shot and kicking, but still resurfaces.
ASSISTANT
Guy Lombardo?
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE, laughs
My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue. [Suddenly choleric] Tomorrow, the world! Bring in my Bluebird.
PEPPERLAND INHABITANTS
Who? Who? Who?
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Who? Who? Who?
The mouth of John expels the question WHO?
A blue big glove crosses the air.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts. [New rage] Smash them! Squash them! Crash them! Oblue-terate them!
MEDICAL DOCTOR, as the Chief collapses
Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.
CHIEF, exuberant
The Glove, the Glove, the Glove!
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Glove? Glove? Glove?
From the mouth of John emerge the word GLOVE.
GEORGE
He's a clever lad, isn't he?
RINGO
Open your mouth, it won't hurt. [Try to see into the mouth of John] John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?
GEORGE
It's easy. All you need is love.
JOHN
Yes.
And expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes.
1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE
Love, love, love (x3)
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
Nothing you can know that isn't known,
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be
that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy
All you need is love, (All together now)
All you need is love, (Everybody)
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
The words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks.
JOHN
Go, Glove, lovely Glove.
RINGO
You took the words right out of my mouth, John.
GEORGE
Hey, wait, and watch. [Floating] It's all in the mind, you know.
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Everything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW.
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
The meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd.
A little bit further they find a blue glass ball.
GEORGE
Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.
JOHN
In Pepperland all things are possible.
PAUL
It's not a goldfish bowl.
RINGO
Just a big glass bowl, then.
PAUL
Yes, blue glass.
RINGO
It must be from Kentucky.
Paul knocks the bowl. Some music starts to sound.
JOHN
There's something inside.
RINGO
Four fellas.
GEORGE
What are they doing there?
PAUL
They're not having a ball, that's for sure.
JOHN
It can't be.
PAUL
It's us.
JOHN
But we're here.
PAUL
It's Sgt. Pepper's...
RINGO
Lonely...
GEORGE
Hearts Club...
GEORGE
Band.
JOHN
The resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here I think the theory put forward
by Einstein…
PAUL, spoofs an old song called ‘Any old iron’
Any old Ein, any old Ein, any, any, any old Einstein.
JOHN
… could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...
The other three try to break the ball.
PAUL
John!
JOHN
… beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...
GEORGE
John!
JOHN
George?
GEORGE
How do we get them out?
JOHN
Break the glass.
GEORGE
We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
JOHN
Nothing is Beatle-proof.
PAUL, to Ringo
Have you got your drumsticks with you? A drum break might shatter it.
RINGO
No, I haven't.
GEORGE
Have a look in your pocket.
1:15:50 “Baby you’re a rich man” is heard.
RINGO
I've got a hole in my pocket. I wonder if...
Ringo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty.
RINGO
Yeah, it still works.
GEORGE
We take back all we said.
JOHN
You're a genius.
PAUL
A sheer genius.
RINGO
I know, I know, I know. [Some colors get out of the ball] Like coloured telly.
GEORGE
Like crystal.
PAUL
They're decanting.
The members of the Band face their peers.
RINGO 2
Hello, brother.
RINGO
Yeah, without a doubt.
GEORGE
We're the spitting image of each other.
GEORGE 2
Golly, yeah.
JOHN
I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.
JOHN 2
Yes, I'm your alter-ego man.
JOHN
And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob. [They walk together] I'm glad you asked me that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the
skirmish must we hence.
JOHN 2
Shall we hence?
PAUL
Let's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge!
The Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide.
JOHN
We're surrounded.
RINGO, pointing the four-headed dog
Nice dog, though.
The Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings:
1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG
Sheepdog... standing in the rain
Bullfrog... doing it again
Some kind of happiness
is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
something special when you smile?
Childlike... no one understands
Jack knife... in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence
is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
Big man... walking in the park
Wigwam... frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude
is measured out in you
You think you know me
but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me,
You can talk to me
You can talk to me...
if you're lonely you can talk to me
Hey, bulldog (x4)
John to the dog:
What do you say? Sing it.
Do you know any more? Play it!
Todos
Hey, bulldog.
The Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from
the branch of a tree.
RINGO
Jeremy, can it be you?
JEREMY
Can it be me? I think you'd better
inquire of the guards,
for when I was captured,
they took all my cards.
RINGO
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole world's being attacked.
JEREMY
What do you want me to do?
Do you recommend fisticuffs
versus the guard?
[With a fighting manual in his hand Jeremy challenges the guard ]
Oh, guard! Blue Meanio!
Left to the nostril, right uppercut,
right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.
Jeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie. Ringo
congratulates Jeremy.
RINGO
Jeremy!
JEREMY
Come on, Ringo!
The Chief treats to stem the rout.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Get back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! You're advancing the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now!
The Chief is swept along.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
My kingdom for a horse! [Jeremy comes close to him] I think I'll tear him up into little pieces.
JEREMY
He does, does he?
CHIEF
I think I'll make a blueburger out of him.
JEREMY
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.
CHIEF
You don't, eh? We'll soon see about that.
JEREMY
He does in truth seem quite annoyed,
[Opens the manual]
some reference material
before I'm destroyed.
Where ground is soft most often grows,
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.
[Suddenly, a rose arise in the Chief nose]
A rosy nose?
CHIEF
Speak your last piece!
JEREMY
Peace, peace,
supplant the doom and the gloom.
Turn off what is sour,
turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom,
bloom, bloom...
A lot of pink roses cover the whole body of the Chief. He flees crazy.
RINGO
First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, I knew he was somebody.
JOHN
You're right. Hello there, blue people. Won't you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go
mingle. What do you say?
CHIEF
Max?
MAX
Your Blue... I mean your Newness!
CHIEF, takes some flowers
It's no longer a blue world, Max. Where could we go?
MAX
Argentina?
JOHN
Are you with us? Will you join?
CHIEF
Shall we?
MAX
No!... [Chief threatens to hit him] Yes, your Newness!
CHIEF, smiles
Yes, Max...
JEREMY, close to them
Yes. Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,
A true, universal, euphonious thing.
In genders embracing
and chasing of blues,
the very best word
for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!
CHIEF
Yes, let us mix, Max. I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of
Happiness.
1:24:41 THE BEATLES : IT’S ALL TOO MUCH
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes,
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside,
the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much
Everybody dance. Jeremy and the Chief reconcile. The Chief cries of
emotion.
Nice to have the time
to take this opportunity
Time for me to look at you,
and you to look at me
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much
1:26:55 PAUL, RINGO, GEORGE AND JOHN IN PERSON
PAUL
Catchy tune, that.
RINGO
I can't seem to get it out of my head.
GEORGE
Then shake it.
RINGO
That's what we've been doing all night.
PAUL
Yeah, it was a great party.
GEORGE
And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs. Here is the motor.
PAUL
I've got a little love.
RINGO
And I've got a hole in my pocket.
PAUL
A hole?
RINGO
Half a hole, anyway. I gave the rest to Jeremy.
GEORGE
What can he do with half a hole?
PAUL
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.
RINGO
Look at John, will you?
John has been looping through a telescope.
PAUL
What's the matter, John? Blue Meanies?
JOHN
Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.
There's only one way to go out.

How's that?

[Intro]

A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right, just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teacher's chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself

Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets (oh) is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling to spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Ooh!

[Bridge]

Ooh!

Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, in mama's head it's got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Hand me my umbrella when she says she wish she was mine

Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some

Standing in the garden waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Looking at the bench of next door neighbors
Crying to my mom of diamond tooth sabers
Everybody's got to have something hard to hold
Well instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son and make you one
You gotta get out son and make you one

Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry cry I know
Shoot big
Shoot big

Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big

Until you shoot big

238,Within You Without You/Tomorrow Never Knows,"November 21, 2006",Love,"

Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying

We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people

Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away

We were talking
About the love we all could share
When we find it

To try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world
If they only knew

Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

243,Sour Milk Sea,,George Harrison,"

[Verse 1]
If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
Don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out, find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon, you don't have long

[Chorus 1]
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there

[Verse 2]
If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there

[Chorus 2]
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there

Do-do-doo

Looking for release from limitation
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way really brings results

[Chorus 3]
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there

Good King Wenceslas looked out
On the feast of Stephen (Hoo!)
As the slow ray round about
Deep and crisp and crispy
Brightly show the boot last night
On the mosty cruel
Henry Hall and David Lloyd
Betty Grable too

[John] Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice. (Huh!) We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already, but we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show

[All] (whistling)

[John] This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because ""Love Me Do"" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul, (Arf-arf! Arf-arf!) I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October. (Huh!) I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime:

Garry Crimble to you
Garry Mimble to you
Getty Bable, dear Christmas
Happy Birthday me too

[Paul] This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like Jelly Babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off Jelly Babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing

[John] Yes! Yes! Oh yes!

[Paul] Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio...

[John] Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!

[Paul] ...to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop and Ringo...

[All] Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shouting, those animals!

[Paul] ...so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription

[John] Ja, das wird uns danke schon
Und denn gruss von even
Ja, denn gruss von even schon
Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy
Danke schon

Ja, Ringo!

Hello, Ringo here
As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups...

(Oh, just wish the people a merry, happy, go on, for Christmas, Christmas)

Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted
(Sing, sing us Wenceslas, King Wenceslas)
King Wenceslas:

Well, good King Wenceslas looked out (Oh ho!)
On the feast of Stephen (Hey!)
When the snow was on the ground (Yeah!)
Deep and crisp and even (Oh yeah!)

Hooray!

Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! (Ha ha ha!)
I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool. (Good old Freda!) So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters
And I'd just like to say:

Brightly was the shone that night
Though the winter cruel
When a pork pie came inside
Gathering winter cruel

Had a very shiny nose (A shiny nose!)

[Speech]

[Brian Matthew] Before we hear another song, fellows, there is a few things I'd like to ask you. First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?
[John, Paul, George, and Ringo] (Comedic yawning)
[Paul] We don't think so, really
[Brian] You don't ever think that?
[Paul] Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubbish about you, which you get often
[John] Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids
[Brian] Now, what do you, eh--
[Paul] (Laughs)
[Brian] --well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?
[John] No, she knows I'm not divorced, because I keep seeing her every day, you see
[Brian] Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, eh""
[Paul] Like riding on a bus?
[Brian] Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you--
[Paul] Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things
[John] We go to certain ones
[George] And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, because they pretend they don't know us
[Paul] Joe's CafAc!
[Brian] Yeah, that figures
[Paul] Joe's CafAc! Social statement, that, you know
[George] It is

Hallelujah, I just love that chick so

20:21 - 20:24
It's rather a jolly place.
20:24 - 20:27
- Soup, please.
- Soup, yeah.
20:27 - 20:29
He has three hours to live.
20:29 - 20:33
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
20:33 - 20:35
I ordered soup too.
20:35 - 20:48
- Soup!
- Soup.
20:48 - 20:53
Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.
20:53 - 20:55
- Unless I'm mistaken.
- Is it?
20:55 - 20:59
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.
20:59 - 21:00
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
21:00 - 21:04
Excuse me. if he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,
21:04 - 21:06
why is he not painted red?
21:06 - 21:14
I've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend I will.
21:14 - 21:17
- Whats this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.
21:17 - 21:21
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.
21:21 - 21:23
All are happy to go.
21:23 - 21:26
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring
21:26 - 21:29
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.
21:29 - 21:33
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
21:33 - 21:38
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so I'm told, with that ring.
21:38 - 21:39
Three hours to live.
21:39 - 21:43
- (Man) You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.
21:43 - 21:46
You are lucky to be chosen!
21:46 - 21:51
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.
21:51 - 21:54
- Whats this?
- A season ticket.
21:54 - 22:00
I like a lot of seasoning in my soup.
22:00 - 22:02
There's somebody been in this soup.
22:02 - 22:06
I got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.
22:06 - 22:11
I get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.
22:11 - 22:13
No? Come off!
22:13 - 22:17
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,
22:17 - 22:19
who will then go happy to Kaili.
22:19 - 22:22
- Thank you.
- (Bhuta) Three hours.
22:22 - 22:24
There's a footprint in here.
22:24 - 22:28
Here, you have a go.
22:28 - 22:35
(Gasps) Flee!
22:35 - 22:54
(Woman screams)
22:54 - 22:57
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.
22:57 - 22:59
(Laughs)
22:59 - 23:01
This ring is not stone.
23:01 - 23:12
- I've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.
23:12 - 23:17
- I don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?
23:17 - 23:20
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.
23:20 - 23:26
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.
23:26 - 23:28
Three ten.
23:28 - 23:30
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.
23:30 - 23:34
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.
23:34 - 23:46
(Whirring)
23:46 - 23:49
- I've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.
23:49 - 23:53
- I suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.
23:53 - 23:56
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.
23:56 - 24:01
- Did you want them to?
- No. I left it there when not at school.
24:01 - 24:03
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.
24:03 - 24:09
(Electronic beeping)
24:09 - 24:12
I like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.
24:12 - 24:14
This won't work.
24:14 - 24:17
It could work if the government
would spend more money.
24:17 - 24:20
Made in America you see.
24:20 - 24:22
Another failure.
24:22 - 24:25
The idea is...
The idea as I see it
24:25 - 24:29
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.
24:29 - 24:33
- Whats your electricity bill like?
- It's sort of a long counterfoil.
24:33 - 24:37
It's not dropping off.
24:37 - 24:41
Voltage!
Voltage... up, up...
24:41 - 24:43
Up, up!
24:43 - 24:46
- Are you sure I'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.
24:46 - 24:50
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.
24:50 - 24:52
This is English.
24:52 - 24:55
- Is it green, the earth in America?
- In some places its brown.
24:55 - 24:57
He's not earthed.
24:57 - 25:04
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. I ask you!
25:04 - 25:07
Done.
25:07 - 25:10
- 5... 4...
- Come on.
25:10 - 25:15
3-2-1-go! I observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.
25:15 - 25:18
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.
25:18 - 25:22
It's the plugs.
Good British plugs.
25:22 - 25:26
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.
25:26 - 25:28
- How do you feel?
- I used to use my hands.
25:28 - 25:32
He used to use his hands.
25:32 - 25:35
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?
25:35 - 25:41
- Voltage... up!
- I'm no mean hand at the old sticks.
25:41 - 25:42
The voltage, up, up, up!
25:42 - 25:48
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!
25:48 - 25:52
The bunker!
25:52 - 25:59
(Electronic humming)
25:59 - 26:03
- I can't watch.
- It's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.
26:03 - 26:10
(Whirring)
26:10 - 26:12
Stop it!
26:12 - 26:14
It's more than my job's worth!
26:14 - 26:17
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.
26:17 - 26:31
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!
26:31 - 26:33
Fantastic!
26:33 - 26:37
With a ring like that I could,
dare I say it, rule the world.
26:37 - 26:40
I must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.
26:40 - 26:44
Get your hands off him
or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!
26:44 - 26:46
The laser...
26:46 - 26:50
- Get him off.
- I must have this ring. The laser.
26:50 - 26:55
Halt! Release him or I'll shoot
and I am a dead eyeshot shooting.
26:55 - 27:01
- I've got it.
- Switch off that machine.
27:01 - 27:04
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...
27:04 - 27:07
I'm better with animals
than plugs and transistors.
27:07 - 27:10
MIT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them.
27:10 - 27:13
Daddy being the local master
of the hounds.
27:13 - 27:16
That's where I get it from,
my love of animals.
27:16 - 27:20
They trust me.
I should have been in vivisection.
27:20 - 27:24
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.
27:24 - 27:28
Well, that was a mistake.
I can vouch for her. We're very close.
27:28 - 27:32
- Lasers ready.
- Get them!
27:32 - 27:35
(Laser Beeps)
27:35 - 27:38
(Bang)
27:38 - 27:42
It's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.
27:42 - 27:50
It's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.

Now see what you've done
with your filthy Eastern ways.
30:03 - 30:07
No! it is Clang, the High Priest,
who is filthy in his ways.
30:07 - 30:10
(Posh accent) How do we know
you're not sent by him to nick the ring,
30:10 - 30:13
when you've lulled us
with your filthy ways?
30:13 - 30:16
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.
30:16 - 30:21
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen
30:21 - 30:24
and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili.
30:24 - 30:32
Now my sister is safe and rises up.
30:32 - 30:35
(Soft clang)
30:35 - 30:39
(Ahme) 'And a new day dawns,
a new victim is chosen...'
30:39 - 30:45
From this moment it is death to him
who wears the ring.
30:45 - 30:48
This will make your finger shrink.
Be brave.
30:48 - 30:49
Don't look.
30:49 - 30:55
Alas, if he were brave
this would not be necessary.
30:55 - 31:05
(Birds chirp)
31:05 - 31:08
Where've you been?
You've been up that temple again.
31:08 - 31:21
You're as bad as your sister, coming
home from work at all hours and colours.
31:21 - 31:23
There might be some insurance.
31:23 - 31:26
I wouldn't think of such a thing!
Find out.
31:26 - 31:28
What did you say that stuff is?
31:28 - 31:32
This will just make his finger shrink
a little. It's a minor medical secret.
31:32 - 31:35
I'm sure there's no call for all this.
31:35 - 31:39
I'm allergic to Penicillin
and all them other wonder drugs.
31:39 - 31:42
- Gum?
- Are you sure its not or habit forming?
31:42 - 32:03
No. As long as you don't swallow it.
32:03 - 32:06
(Whispers) All right.
Synchronise your watches.
32:06 - 32:15
You, you, you and you.
Paint him red and then kill him.
32:15 - 32:17
Kaili.
32:17 - 32:20
Kaili. Kaili.
32:20 - 32:25
I promise you
the effect is purely transitory.
32:25 - 32:26
It wears off very quickly.
32:26 - 32:31
(Doorbell rings)
(Ahme) Don't answer it! It's Clang.
32:31 - 32:33
(Hollering and knocking)
32:33 - 32:37
- Perhaps it won't take...
- This is a dreadful miscarriage.
32:37 - 32:38
(Hollering)
32:38 - 32:41
(Ringo) Come on, my finger!
32:41 - 32:43
Where's Paul?
32:43 - 32:48
Where's Paul? Come on, Paul,
stop messing about.
32:48 - 32:50
Where's he gone?
32:50 - 33:13
- Where are you, Paul?
- It's his best suit.
33:13 - 33:19
Don't look right or left. They might take
us for innocent bystanders.
33:19 - 33:24
(Baby crying)
33:24 - 33:26
- Standby.
- (Whispers) Standby.
33:26 - 33:29
Look out!
They're coming through the door!
33:29 - 33:35
(Knocking)
33:35 - 33:41
- Go!
- Go!
33:41 - 33:49
(Yells) Kaili!
33:49 - 33:55
Kaili... Oh!
33:55 - 34:00
- Sorry, I hit him.
- Oh!
34:00 - 34:03
Get me the home office.
He's wrecking my home.
34:03 - 34:08
Kaili! Kaili!
34:08 - 34:13
(Gasps) Get off!
34:13 - 34:16
- It's me, you fool.
- Oh, sorry.
34:16 - 34:21
Well, stop it!
34:21 - 35:02
Feet! Feet, you fool!
35:02 - 35:13
(Growls)
35:13 - 35:19
(Sobs)
35:19 - 35:25
Kaili! He's red! Kill him!
35:25 - 35:34
(Gunshot)
35:34 - 35:37
Oh, my goodness gosh!
Withdraw! Withdraw!
35:37 - 35:40
Up!
35:40 - 35:42
Up, up, up!
35:42 - 35:44
- You!
- Which one has the ring?
35:44 - 35:46
That one with the large ned.
35:46 - 35:48
Neb!
And its yours.
35:48 - 35:54
- Keep your hands up.
- How can I get it off with my hands up?
35:54 - 35:56
In the name of science
I demand that ring.
35:56 - 35:57
It's yours!
35:57 - 36:01
- It's worth something.
- A couple of bob, at least.
36:01 - 36:05
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.
36:05 - 36:09
With a ring like that
could I interest the military?
36:09 - 36:11
No, I could not.
36:11 - 36:15
I can't get it off.
36:15 - 36:18
(Squelch)
36:18 - 36:20
- Paul?
- Look, what you've done.
36:20 - 36:24
- Hey, is that Paul?
- Algernon, my little black bag.
36:24 - 36:27
I shall have to operate.
36:27 - 36:29
It'll be on the National Health,
won't it?
36:29 - 36:33
- (Whooshing)
- Look!
36:33 - 36:36
Ugh! I'm all sticky. You're all red!
36:36 - 36:39
- We thought that was you.
- No that's not me.
36:39 - 36:43
I'm glad it wore off quickly.
36:43 - 36:46
What are you doing here?
36:46 - 36:51
- (Hammer clicks)
- Get out!
36:51 - 36:55
British, you see! Useless.
If I had a Luger...
36:55 - 36:59
Their scientists are properly equipped.
Think on it.
36:59 - 37:09
The remedy is in your hands...
you, the voters.
37:09 - 37:15
- Where's Ahme?
- I don't know.
37:15 - 37:23
(Speaks in Eastern language)
37:23 - 37:28
(Continues speaking
in Eastern language)
37:28 - 37:31
- Hai?
- What? Yes... Hai.
37:31 - 37:34
(Continues speaking
in Eastern language)
37:34 - 37:37
I don't understand a word.
I don't speak the language.
37:37 - 37:40
Latin, yes. But this Eastern babble, no.
37:40 - 37:58
Ah, the ring! Come on, we go.

I've got it... No, I haven't,
its gone past!
42:18 - 42:21
Send this one straight.
42:21 - 42:23
I've got it... No, I haven't.
42:23 - 42:25
- Look out!
- Get away!
42:25 - 42:28
I am easing the fuse in now.
42:28 - 42:30
What?
42:30 - 42:32
I know, you fool. I'm here.
Steady.
42:32 - 42:36
Steady. I am steady.
42:36 - 42:38
Now a turn to the right and it locks.
42:38 - 42:42
I am turning it to the right.
It is locking.
42:42 - 42:44
That's what comes
of teaching science by TV.
42:44 - 42:46
You'll thank me in the end.
42:46 - 42:48
I am lifting it up.
42:48 - 42:50
(Curling stone ticks)
42:50 - 42:53
- I am moving my left leg...
- Hurry up!
42:53 - 42:58
- I am moving my right leg.
- Oh, give it to me!
42:58 - 43:04
- Call it a day.
- It's curling stone day.
43:04 - 43:08
When the ice breaks dive straight in.
It's the right hand.
43:08 - 43:10
(Mutters) it won't work.
43:10 - 43:15
Soft game... broom sticks.
43:15 - 43:16
Thank you.
43:16 - 43:18
Throw it, George.
43:18 - 43:20
That was good.
43:20 - 43:22
Great.
43:22 - 43:25
Hey, its a thingy.
43:25 - 43:27
(Hollers) A fiendish thingy!
43:27 - 43:29
It was so fast, its smoking.
43:29 - 43:36

44:31 - 44:34
In the name of Kaili, stop!
Stop!
44:34 - 44:38
Argh!
44:38 - 44:41
My blood group is very unusual.
Look!
44:41 - 44:55

This way, Swami.
45:01 - 45:13

They have to paint me red

46:40 - 46:42
It's a different religion from ours...

46:42 - 46:47

46:47 - 46:50
So this is the famous Beatles?
46:50 - 46:53
So this is the famous Scotland Yard?
46:53 - 46:55
How long do you think you'll last?
46:55 - 46:59
You can't say fairer than that.
Great Train Robbery, how's that going?

47:03 - 47:06
- Chief Superintendent.
- (Man) 'Ringo, please.'
47:06 - 47:09
- It's for you, the famous Ringo.
- It's them.
47:09 - 47:12
- Only me and Paul know we're here.
- I know.
47:12 - 47:18
Allow me. I'm a bit of a famous mimic.
You know... James Cagney.
47:18 - 47:21
(Liverpool accent)
Hello, this is the famous Ringo,
47:21 - 47:24
what is it that I can do for you?
47:24 - 47:26
Not a bit like Cagney.
47:26 - 47:30
- (Clang) 'Go to the window.'
- Hey, it is them!
47:30 - 47:32
(Clang) 'Go to the window.'
47:32 - 47:35
Go to the window.
47:35 - 47:38
Go to the window.
47:38 - 47:41
Go to the window.

47:55 - 47:59
There's a strong case for arming
the police. We're not all masochists.
47:59 - 48:02
- Now see?
- I believe you. Thousands wouldn't.
48:02 - 48:06
Right, lets get going.
Pass me the phone, will you?
48:06 - 48:09
Lifeline of the service.
Dial 999.
48:09 - 48:13
We need protection.
We've got a record to do tomorrow.
48:13 - 48:15

9th symphony?
67:19 - 67:21
It goes like this...
67:21 - 67:24
(Whistles ""Ode To Joy"")
67:24 - 67:32
(Tiger roars)
67:32 - 67:37
- What?
- This trap door.
67:37 - 67:40
Oh, here you are...
67:40 - 67:46
Permit me.
67:46 - 67:50
It's Raja, the famous Bengal man-eater
who escaped from the zoo this morning.
67:50 - 67:53
- So it is!
- Don't worry, he's harmless.
67:53 - 67:57
All you have to do is sing Beethoven's
Ode to Joy from the 9th symphony.
67:57 - 68:02
- Why didn't you think of that?
- Raja was reared on the classics.
68:02 - 68:07
(John) Don't worry, just whistle famous
Beethoven's famous 9th symphony.
68:07 - 68:09
Come on! Come on!
68:09 - 68:11
(Sings ""Ode To Joy"" in German)
68:11 - 68:37
(Everybody sings)
68:37 - 68:45
(Chorus sings ""Ode To Joy"")
68:45 - 68:57
(Cheering)
68:57 - 68:59
Beep, beep!
68:59 - 69:01
Psst!
69:01 - 69:04
- (Ringo) Who let it out?
- Nobody will know.
69:04 - 69:07
We're not going there.
69:07 - 69:11
- We just put it round we're going there.
- We're not going there.
69:11 - 69:15
- We just put it round.
- So everyone thinks we're going there?
69:15 - 69:17
- I'd like to go there.
- You wouldn't like it.
69:17 - 69:33
- Where are we going?
- Never you mind.
69:33 - 69:42
(Cameras click)
69:42 - 70:05
- You're welcome.
- Goodbye, sir.
70:05 - 70:43
Him!
70:43 - 70:46
- Welcome to Nassau.
- Thank you very much.
70:46 - 70:50
I'd like to present PC 17...
70:50 - 70:52

- Very smart.
70:52 - 70:55

70:55 - 70:58

71:05 - 71:13

71:13 - 71:16
You should have thought of that
before you left the house.
71:16 - 71:20
Left... To shore...

Whoa, whoa, whoa!
74:10 - 74:13
- Is that it?
- Better watch your fingers, Ringo!
74:13 - 74:17
Clang had the whole temple transported
here for your sacrifice.
74:17 - 74:19
He needn't have bothered.
Very nice of him, though.
74:19 - 74:23
- Whats this?
- This is where you'll be disembowelled.
74:23 - 74:26
You don't go for all that,
do you?
74:26 - 74:28
Keeps you busy, eh?
74:28 - 74:32
- Do you know where Clang is?
- I'm his mother and he's a good boy.

(Hollering)
74:33 - 74:36
I don't want to knock
anyone's religion, but...
74:36 - 74:41
- In here, quick.
- (Ringo) I can't swim.
74:41 - 74:50
I'm not going!
74:50 - 75:10
Where have they gone?
75:10 - 75:12
- Lets go back and get them!
- I'm game.
75:12 - 75:16
- Lets smash them!
- Lets find that temple.
75:16 - 75:20
- A man's got to do what he's got to do.
- I don't like running away.
75:20 - 75:23
- Lets go back and get them.
- They'll disembowel us.
75:23 - 75:27
- Not if I get the boot in first.
- Lets go back and get them.
75:27 - 75:46
They won't disembowel us, you see.
That's all gab - disembowelling...
75:46 - 75:49
- Signpost.
- Signpost.
75:49 - 75:52
- Guide book.
- Guide book.
75:52 - 75:56
- Feet.
- Feet? Oh, feet!
75:56 - 75:57
Red light.
75:57 - 76:00
Kaili!
76:00 - 76:12
- Green light, go!
- (Yells) Kaili!
76:12 - 76:15
The things we have to do
in these heathen countries.
76:15 - 76:29
There must be an easier way
to set a trap!
76:29 - 76:34
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
- What does he say?
76:34 - 76:37
Passing this way with hot foot
to the temple.
76:37 - 76:40
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.
76:40 - 76:44
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! I saw those footprints...
76:44 - 76:47
And this guidebook.
76:47 - 77:03
- To the temple.
- (Whistles)
77:03 - 77:21
After them... slowly!
77:21 - 77:25
- That's not it, is it?
- It's on the map as being here.
77:25 - 77:30
That temple under the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...
77:30 - 77:34
- I'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?
77:34 - 77:38
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. It's gone.
77:38 - 77:41
I hope that disembowelling thingy
has gone, too.
77:41 - 77:44
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.
77:44 - 77:49
Old army place. Well-known
place of retreat for courting couples
77:49 - 77:51
who like the echoes of bugles
as they court.
77:51 - 77:54
That's my theory.
77:54 - 77:56
Ugh!
77:56 - 77:58
- Aren't we going in?
- No, lets not.
77:58 - 78:01
Oh, come on lads,
where's that famous pluck?
78:01 - 78:04
- I haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.
78:04 - 78:08
- I have had.
- I will have.
78:08 - 78:10
He's a bit soft that inspector,
isn't he?
78:10 - 78:12
He never takes his hat off.
78:12 - 78:30
It's very hot over here
for wearing a hat.
78:30 - 78:35
- I'm off.
- Typical!
78:35 - 78:37
(Yells) Kaili!
78:37 - 78:39
Argh!
78:39 - 78:44
- Kaili!
- Kaili!
78:44 - 78:46
(Electric buzz)
78:46 - 78:50
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension. HT.
78:50 - 79:06
The fiends!
79:06 - 79:08
(Hollers) Help me!
79:08 - 79:10
Help!
79:10 - 79:12
He's mine!
79:12 - 79:15
Help!
79:15 - 79:42
Help me!
79:42 - 79:48
There's one on the back,
but its not the right one.
79:48 - 79:54
Come here, boy! Let me explain.
79:54 - 80:00
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.
80:00 - 80:03
Back up and smash him off.
80:03 - 80:07
(Algernon) Now, this will get him!
80:07 - 80:11
Oh! Never mind. Try again.
80:11 - 80:17
This should give him a headache.
80:17 - 80:20
Where's he gone?
80:20 - 80:23
- That's done it, he's gone.
- I can't start the car.
80:23 - 80:26
- (Engine splutters)
- Hello.
80:26 - 80:31
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...
80:31 - 80:36
On, on!
80:36 - 80:38
I seem to be having
a slight difficulty.
80:38 - 80:51
To the right! oh...
80:51 - 80:56
- I think it might be the wrong key.
- On!
80:56 - 80:59
On!
80:59 - 81:04
(Engine starts)
81:04 - 81:20
(Algernon) Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?
81:20 - 81:28
Thanks for the lift, sailor!
81:28 - 81:31
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.
81:31 - 81:33
- He's got a plan.
- Avery famous plan.
81:33 - 81:35
Superintendent, you've got a plan.
81:35 - 81:37
- Yes...
- Superintendent.
81:37 - 83:21
I've got a plan.
83:21 - 83:23
(Hollers) Ringo!
83:23 - 83:25
Ringo!
83:25 - 83:28
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
83:28 - 83:30
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
83:30 - 83:32
Ringo!
83:32 - 83:34
(Dogs bark)
83:34 - 83:46
Ringo!
83:46 - 83:47
All right, talk!
83:47 - 83:55
We know he's a prisoner,
but where?
83:55 - 83:57
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?
83:57 - 84:00
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- He was asked to take it up.
84:00 - 84:03
Alas... Scalpel.
84:03 - 84:12
Sca...
84:12 - 84:15
Sand in the generator.
84:15 - 84:18
It gets everywhere. No wonder
I never get anything done.
84:18 - 84:21
Fix it, Algernon.
84:21 - 84:24
You wouldn't want me to go in
with a blunt scalpel.
84:24 - 84:26
Fix it!
84:26 - 84:30
I'm a decent employer,
but he takes advantage of me.
84:30 - 84:37
- It's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.
84:37 - 84:40
I've got some juice.
84:40 - 84:44
(Ringo) I can't understand it. They kept
pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!
84:44 - 84:48
- Whats that?
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.
84:48 - 84:52
Hands up!
84:52 - 84:54
- Whats that?
- Distilled from the essence...
84:54 - 84:59
Not distilled from the essence of orchids
found only in certain recesses?
84:59 - 85:05
At last! I'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tberius Foot Juice!
85:05 - 85:08
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that I have this.
85:08 - 85:11
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...
85:11 - 85:15
It's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home,
for England! A jewel set in the sea!
85:15 - 85:18
The government in the palm of my hand.
Whats it say?
85:18 - 85:20
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!
85:20 - 85:24
- (Algernon) I don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?
85:24 - 85:27
- (Algernon) I don't think so.
- Lets get it translated.
85:27 - 85:33
- Now!
- Right!
85:33 - 85:43
- I can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?
85:43 - 85:46
(Clang) Treacherous Woman,
tremble...
85:46 - 85:49
In the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains,
85:49 - 85:52
whose embrace with Rani
made the whole world tremble.
85:52 - 85:55
- Wait till my mates get you.
- I don't think so...
85:55 - 86:00
We've had two battalions flown in
specially to ambush your friends.
86:00 - 86:02
They're quite merciless.
86:02 - 86:08
One word of warning from you
and you die instantly.
86:08 - 86:11
Oh, mother Kaili,
86:11 - 86:13
whose name is the Terrible...
86:13 - 86:15
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
86:15 - 86:18
(Clang) ...whose name
is the inaccessible,
86:18 - 86:24
whose name is the Black Mother,
mother of darkness!
86:24 - 86:25
We turn our hearts to...
86:25 - 86:27
(Ringo) No!
86:27 - 86:29
(Clang) ...drinker of blood...
86:29 - 86:32
- It's off! I'm saved!
- ...killer of demons,
86:32 - 86:36
drink of this vessel,
gorge on this blood, our offering...
86:36 - 86:40
Get sacrificed!
I don't subscribe to your religion!
86:40 - 86:44
- There he is!
- It just came off!
86:44 - 86:46
(Yells) Quickly! After them!
86:46 - 86:48
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
86:48 - 86:52
- It came off! I just showed courage.
- How many fingers you got left?
86:52 - 86:55
- You're all red again.
- I'm beginning to like it.

[Intro]
1, 2, 3, 4

[Verse 1]
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
The problems you sow are the troubles you're reaping
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 2]
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you

[Verse 3]
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Verse 4]
I don't know why you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

[Verse 5]
I look at the trouble and pain that is raging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps

[Outro]
Gently weeps
Still my guitar gently weeps

London, Paris, Rome and New York,

Oh, ev'rywhere it's Christmas,
And I'm off to join the cheer!

Oh, ev'rywhere it's Christmas,

(P): No, don't worry. I'll play this one. Do you like this one? Listen to this one.

(P): (Singing)
Please don't bring your banjo bag,
I know where it's been.
I wasn't hardly gone a day
When it became the scene.
Banjos, banjos all the time,
I can't forget that tune.

(All): (Singing)
And if I ever see another banjo,
I'm going out to buy a big balloon,
And if I ever see another banjo,
I'm going out to buy a big balloon,
And if I ever see another banjo,
I'm going out to buy a toy balloon,
And if I ever see another banjo,
I'm going out to buy a toy balloon,

I'm going out to buy a toy balloon,

Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?

In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save

(J): Wonsaponatime, there were two balloons called
Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen
In a million years. They were together man. Unfortunatimetable, they seemed to have previous experience which
Kept calling them one way oranother (you know howitis)
But they battled on against overwhelming oddities
Including some of there beast friends. Being in love
They cloong together even more man. But some of the
Poisonessmonsters of outrated buslodedapethrowers did
Stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to
The dry cleaners. Luckily this did not kill them and
They weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived
Hopefully ever after and who could blame them

[sample - Baroque Hoedown by Jean-Jacques Perrey and Gershon Kingsley]

(G): Well, here we are again, another fab Christmas. Christmas
Time is here again. Ain't been around since last year
And we'd like to take this opportunity, all the way from
America, to say happy Christmas to you our faithful
Beloved fans all over the world who have made our life
Worth living. And over here I have Mr. Malcolm Evans who
Through thick and thin would surely like to say a word
Of greeting at this festive occasion

(J): Once upon a pool table there lived a short-haired
Butcher's boy by the way of Ostergrad. It comes in
Sentencesspoolararrowic Airport. Her father was in a
Long story cut short in the middle of his life sentence
We're indebted to the Colloquial office for its immediate
Disposal of her honorwitz, including, I might add, hoc virtallo a totem. On the other handbag, I mean to say
L'amoure ne soome tu joure realistic, strictly speaking
For this film is about an hourglass houseboat. The full
Meaning of Winchester Cathedral defies description. Their
Loss was our Gainsborough nil

Up in a love-dizzy gar-di-dell time. How close can you

We have a special guest here this evening, Mr
Tiny Tim. I'd like to ask him to say a few words

(T): Oh, hello to you nice Beatles. Ah, it's so wonderful
What a thrill it is talking here. Ah, in Mr. Harrison's
Presence, Mr. Weiss' presence, and all his nice wonderful
Friends. And the thing is, I just wanna say Merry
Christmas to you all. And, ah, a Happy New Year

(G): Thank you, Tiny. Would you like to sing us a little song?

(T): Ah, I'd love to. Here's a song I did in 1966 in front of
Miss Jill for the first time. And I did this in Albert
Hall, and what a thrill it was, ah, to do this then, and
Now ... exactly the way I did it then

(Singing)
He's a, ooh, real nowhere man
Living in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody

Hasn't got a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?

Nowhere man, (yes?) Don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Nowhere man, the world's at your command, ooh

He's a, huh huh, real nowhere man
Living in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody, ooh, ooh

You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down

I never give you my number

Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent

Any job, I got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go

But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go

Didn't anybody see?

Tuesday's on the phone to me

She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob

Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?

Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah

Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
