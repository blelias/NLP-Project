0,Let It Be,"May 8, 1970",Let It Be,"

[Verse 1]
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 2]
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

[Verse 3]
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, ""Let it be""

[Chorus]
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

2,Yesterday,"September 13, 1965",Help! (UK),"

[Verse 1]
Yesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Verse 2]
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Chorus]
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday

[Verse 3]
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday

[Outro]
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-hmm
